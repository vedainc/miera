#+TITLE: Miera
* Overview
Miera is a collection of Lisp CLI scripts designed for various system automation
and utility tasks. The scripts designed to work on Unix and Unix-like operating
systems. It contains a variety of utility functions, commands, and
configurations for managing system and application settings, as well as device
management on Linux or Unix-like systems.  It includes packages for running
shell commands using [[https://github.com/fare/inferior-shell][inferior-shell]], automating managing keymaps, creating
symlinks, handling application launchers, configuring devices like keyboards and
touchpads, and interacting with the system environmentâ€”such as setting locales,
configuring backlight, or managing Bluetooth devices.
* Install system dependencies
Before installing Miera, you need to install the required system dependencies.
These dependencies vary based on the system that you're using.
*** Nix
#+begin_src sh
nix profile install nixpkgs#sbcl nixpkgs#cl-launch nixpkgs#gnumake
#+end_src
*** Debian/Ubuntu
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install -y sbcl cl-launch make
#+end_src
*** Fedora/CentOS
#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf install -y sbcl cl-launch make
#+end_src
*** Arch Linux
#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S sbcl cl-launch make
#+end_src
* Install lisp dependencies
After installing the system dependencies, you'll need to install the necessary
Lisp dependencies using /Quicklisp/. This can be done as follows:
#+begin_src sh
sbcl --noinform --eval "(mapc #'ql:quickload '(:inferior-shell :local-time :ironclad :clon :cl-launch :fare-utils :cl-scripting))" --quit
#+end_src
Next, clone the repository containing Miera:
#+begin_src sh
mkdir ~/common-lisp
cd ~/common-lisp
git clone https://github.com/vedainc/miera
#+end_src
* Install the scripts themselves
Once you've installed al the dependencies, you can install the scripts by running:
#+begin_src sh
make -C ~/common-lisp/miera install
#+end_src
